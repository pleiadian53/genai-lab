## Related Projects

### [causal-bio-lab](../causal-bio-lab/) — Causal AI/ML for Computational Biology

**Complementary Focus:** While `genai-lab` focuses on **modeling data-generating processes** through generative models, `causal-bio-lab` focuses on **uncovering causal structures** and **estimating causal effects** from observational and interventional data.

**Synergy:**

- **Generative models** (VAE, diffusion) can learn rich representations but may capture spurious correlations
- **Causal methods** (probabilistic graphical models, causal discovery, structural equations) ensure models capture true mechanisms, not just statistical patterns
- **Together:** Causal generative models combine the best of both worlds—realistic simulation with causal guarantees

**Key Integration Points:**

1. **Causal representation learning:** Learn disentangled latent spaces that respect causal structure (causal VAEs, identifiable VAEs)
2. **Causal discovery for architecture:** Use learned causal graphs to constrain generative model structure
3. **Counterfactual validation:** Use causal inference methods (do-calculus, structural equations) to validate generated predictions
4. **Causal regularization:** Apply invariance principles and interventional consistency losses for better generalization

**Example Workflow:**

```text
1. Train a CVAE on gene expression data (genai-lab)
2. Discover causal gene regulatory network (causal-bio-lab)
3. Constrain VAE latent space to respect causal structure
4. Generate counterfactual perturbation responses with causal guarantees
5. Estimate treatment effects using both generative and causal methods
```

**Why This Matters for Computational Biology:**

- **Drug discovery:** Generate realistic molecular perturbations while ensuring causal mechanisms are preserved
- **Treatment response:** Predict individual-level effects (counterfactuals) with uncertainty quantification
- **Target identification:** Discover causal drivers, not just biomarkers
- **Combination therapy:** Model synergistic effects through causal interaction terms

See `causal-bio-lab` Milestone 0.5 (SCMs) and Milestone D (Causal Representation Learning) for integration work.
